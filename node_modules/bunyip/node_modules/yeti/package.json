Yeti can help.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yui/yeti.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yui/yeti) [![npm Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/yeti.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/yeti) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/yui/yeti.png)](https://david-dm.org/yui/yeti)\n\nYeti automates tests written for various test frameworks.\nYeti scales from your dev box (where it works by itself)\nto your CI system (where it launches browsers with Selenium)\nwithout changing your existing tests.\n\n## Features\n\n - Works with the frameworks you already use.\n - Automates tests without any additional software. Selenium not required!\n - Built-in code coverage provided by [Istanbul][].\n - Works with IE 6+, Android 4+, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, iOS 4+.\n - Server-side AJAX testing with [echoecho][ee].\n - JUnit XML output makes Yeti play nice with Jenkins.\n - Workload can be split across multiple instances of the same browser.\n - Optional Selenium/WebDriver browser launching. Works great with Sauce Labs.\n\n## Test Frameworks\n\nYou can use any of these test frameworks with Yeti.\n\n - [QUnit][]\n - [Jasmine][]\n - [Mocha][] with [Expect.js][] assertions\n - [Dojo Objective Harness][DOH]\n - [YUI Test][yuitest]\n - Your framework here. Submit a pull request!\n\n## Install Yeti\n\n    npm install -g yeti\n\nYeti requires Node.js, which provides the `npm` command for installation.\nYou can [download Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) source or pre-built\ninstallers from their website.\n\n## Using Yeti\n\nJust run Yeti with the HTML files containing your tests.\n\n    $ yeti test/*.html\n    Creating a Hub at http://localhost:9000\n    Waiting for agents to connect at http://localhost:9000.\n    When ready, press Enter to begin testing.\n\nPoint your browsers at that URL, then come back and press Enter.\n\n    [Open some browsers...]\n\n      Agent connected: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n      Agent connected: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n\n    [Come back, press Enter]\n\n    ✔ Testing started on Safari (6.0) / Mac OS, Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n    504 tests passed! (9.1 seconds)\n    $\n\n#### Exit status codes\n\nYeti exits automatically when all tests complete. If test failures occur, Yeti will exit with a non-zero status code.\n\n- `0` indicates testing was completed and all tests passed.\n- `1` indicates an error occurred that prevented testing from running to completion.\n- `3` indicated testing was completed but some tests failed.\n\nThese codes are useful for using Yeti programmatically. The codes `0` and `3` indicate testing completion.\nIf Yeti ended in code `1`, you may wish to retry the command to workaround transient errors. This is useful\nwhen using Yeti to launch browsers in CI, which sometimes may fail due to temporary Selenium issues.\n\n#### JUnit XML output\n\nYeti can output machine-readable JUnit XML suitable for use in [Jenkins][] with the `--junit` option.\n\n    $ yeti --junit test/*.html > yeti.xml\n\nYeti will output XML on stdout and status messages on stderr.\n\nWhen using Yeti several times in the same Jenkins job, it's useful to label tests with a prefix\nto distinguish between different Yeti runs after Jenkins merges the reports together. You can\nassign this prefix with the `--name` option.\n\n    $ yeti --name stable --junit test/stable/*.html > stable.xml\n    $ yeti --name flaky --junit test/flaky/*.html > flaky.xml\n\n#### Code coverage\n\nYeti can generate a code coverage report with the `-c` or `--coverage` option.\n\n    $ yeti -c\n    Found 1 file to test.\n      Agent connected: Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS from 127.0.0.1\n    ✓ Testing started on Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS\n    ✓ Agent completed: Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS\n    Coverage summary:\n    Statements   : 96.02% ( 1110/1156 )\n    Branches     : 88.53% ( 772/872 )\n    Functions    : 97.45% ( 229/235 )\n    Lines        : 96.27% ( 1110/1153 )\n    ✓ 397 tests passed! (7 seconds)\n\nUse the `--coverage-report` option to generate reports written to `./coverage`\nor another directory defined by `--coverage-dir`. Values for `--coverage-report` include:\n\n - `lcov` for LCOV and HTML reports.\n - `lcovonly` for LCOV without HTML.\n - `html` for HTML only.\n - `json` for Istanbul JSON.\n - `summary` for the default summary shown above.\n - Any other [report supported by Istanbul][istanbul-report].\n\nYeti instruments all JavaScript files automatically with [Istanbul][]. If you'd prefer to instrument\nyour JavaScript code with Istanbul as a part of a build step, you can pass `--no-instrument`\nto skip all instrumenting. Yeti will still generate code coverage reports if used with\nthe `--coverage` option.\n\nIf you'd like to exclude some JavaScript files from instrumenting, you can pass multiple\n`--instrument-exclude` options defining [minimatch][] patterns to exclude.\n\n    $ yeti -c --instrument-exclude \"**/vendor/**\" --instrument-exclude \"**.nocover.js\"\n\nTo prevent needing to specify these verbose options every time, you can put a\n`coverageOptions` object in your project's `.yeti.json` file containing configuration\nthat is only used with `--coverage`.\n\n    $ cd yui3/src/app\n    $ cat ../../.yeti.json\n    {\n        \"basedir\": \".\",\n        \"glob\": \"**/tests/unit/*.html\",\n        \"coverageOptions\": {\n            \"instrument\": false,\n            \"query\": \"filter=coverage\"\n        }\n    }\n    $ yeti -c # will run with --no-instrument --query \"filter=coverage\"\n    Found 1 file to test.\n      Agent connected: Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS from 127.0.0.1\n    ✓ Testing started on Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS\n    ✓ Agent completed: Chrome (34.0.1825.4) / Mac OS\n    Coverage summary:\n    Statements   : 96.02% ( 1110/1156 )\n    Branches     : 88.53% ( 772/872 )\n    Functions    : 97.45% ( 229/235 )\n    Lines        : 96.27% ( 1110/1153 )\n    ✓ 397 tests passed! (7 seconds)\n\n#### AJAX testing\n\nYeti provides server-side AJAX routes with [echoecho][ee]. Your test can\n[make relative HTTP requests][ee-usage] to test your code against server-side HTTP\nGET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, GET with delay, JSON or JSONP responses via POST,\nor any HTTP status code.\n\nExample supported routes:\n\n - `echo/status/500` returns a 500 response.\n - `echo/delay/3` returns a 200 response after 3 seconds.\n - `echo/jsonp?callback=foo` returns a JSONP response with the given\n    POST data wrapped in a call to `foo`.\n\nNote these routes are intentionally relative paths.\nSee the [echoecho README][ee-readme] for more details.\n\n#### Timeouts\n\nYeti will move on to the next test if a test takes longer than 5 minutes (300 seconds).\nYou can adjust this interval with the `--timeout` option.\n\nThis will run Yeti with a 120 second timeout:\n\n    $ yeti --timeout 120 test.html\n\nThere isn't a general timeout setting. Yeti actively pings browsers about every\n2-5 seconds and disconnects them if they fail to respond to a ping three times.\n\n#### Query string parameters\n\nYou can specify query string parameters to add to your test URLs.\nThis can be used to pass information to your tests that control its behavior.\n\nThis will append `?filter=coverage` to your tests, which is used by the tests\nfor the [YUI Library][YUI] to trigger loading instrumented code.\n\n    $ yeti --query 'filter=coverage' test/*.html\n\n#### Error handling\n\nYeti will report an uncaught exceptions as Script Errors.\n\nYeti enforces [No-Quirks Mode][] in your tests because it may impact DOM-related APIs. [Add a DOCTYPE][doctype] to your test document to fix this.\n\n#### Mobile testing made easy\n\nWhen combined with [localtunnel][], mobile testing is simple. If you're not dealing with sensitive information, startup your Yeti Hub and then run:\n\n    $ localtunnel 9000\n       Port 9000 is now publicly accessible from http://3z48.localtunnel.com ...\n\nYou can then visit that URL on your mobile (or any other) device and have it run new tests.\n\n### Yeti Hub\n\nTo save time, start a Yeti Hub.\n\n    $ yeti --server\n    Yeti Hub listening on port 9000.\n\nPoint browsers at your local Yeti on port 9000. Now, you're ready to run tests without having to reconnect browsers each time.\n\nStarting Yeti in another terminal will connect to that Hub instead of starting a new one\nand will begin testing immediately if browsers are already connected.\n\n    $ yeti test/*.html\n    Connected to http://localhost:9000\n      Agent connected: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n      Agent connected: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Testing started on Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS, Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    504 tests passed! (11.5 seconds)\n    $\n\n#### Sharing\n\nYour Yeti Hub can be shared with other developers.\n\nFirst, I'll start a Hub on test.yeti.cx on port 80.\n\n    $ yeti --server --port 80\n\nGo ahead and point a few browsers there.\n\nNow, others can connect to it from their computer like so:\n\n    $ yeti --hub http://test.yeti.cx/ test/*.html\n    Connected to http://test.yeti.cx/\n    Waiting for agents to connect at http://test.yeti.cx/.\n    When ready, press Enter to begin testing.\n\nYour `pwd` and your test file will be served through the Hub. Like magic.\n\n    [Hit Enter]\n      Agent connected: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n      Agent connected: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Testing started on Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS, Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Safari (6.0) / Mac OS\n    ✔ Agent completed: Chrome (22.0.1221.0) / Mac OS\n    504 tests passed! (8.7 seconds)\n\nThis makes it really simple to setup an ad-hoc testing lab shared with your team.\n\n#### Browser launching\n\nYou can specify the `wd-url` option to connect Yeti to a Selenium 2 Hub using the\nWebDriver protocol. Specifying one or more `caps` options will cause Yeti to launch\nbrowsers for the given capabilities over WebDriver.\n\nFor example, launching 2 Firefox browsers to test multiple files:\n\n    yeti --hub http://example.com --wd-url http://localhost:4444 \\\n         --caps \"browserName=firefox;version=26;platform=Windows XP\" \\\n         --caps \"browserName=firefox;version=26;platform=Windows XP\" test/*.html\n\nOr launching an iPhone simulator on Sauce Labs:\n\n    yeti --caps \"platform=OS X 10.8;version=7;device-orientation=portrait;app=safari;device=iPhone Simulator\" test.html\n\n### Options\n\nHere's a breakdown of all available CLI options.\n\n - *query* (String) Query string parameters to pass to tests.\n - *timeout* (Number in seconds) Test timeout.\n - *hub* (URL) Location of the Yeti Hub to use.\n   Set to `false` or specify `--no-hub` to override a configuration file.\n - *server* Starts a Yeti Hub.\n - *port* (Number) Yeti Hub will listen to this port.\n - *loglevel* (`debug` or `info`) Print debugging information.\n - *caps* (String) Browser capabilities to launch with WebDriver.\n   Should be used with `wd-url`.\n - *wd-url* (URL) WebDriver Hub URL. May contain a username and password.\n - *help* Print usage.\n - *version* Print the Yeti version.\n\n#### Configuration file\n\nYou may use place JSON in a `.yeti.json` file to set project or user specific configuration.\n\nYeti will look for `.yeti.json` in these places:\n\n - Recursively starting in the directory you start Yeti\n - In your home folder\n\nHere is an example `.yeti.json` for the YUI project, which is placed in the repository root:\n\n    {\n        \"hub\": \"http://test.yeti.cx/\",\n        \"basedir\": \".\",\n        \"glob\": \"**/tests/unit/*.html\"\n    }\n\nHere is the breakdown of these settings:\n\n - The *hub* option defines a Yeti Hub URL to use.\n - The *basedir* option indicates that the directory where `.yeti.json` lives is\n    permitted to serve files to the Yeti Hub.\n - The *glob* option defines a pattern to search for test files.\n\nThese settings let YUI developers simply run `yeti` inside of the project directory\nto run tests. Since all tests in the project match the glob pattern, the `yeti`\ncommand works for specific components as well as for the entire project.\n\nThis configuration can be overridden on the command line. For example, to ignore the\nhub setting, you can run Yeti with `--no-hub`.\n\n## Yeti API\n\nYou can `require(\"yeti\")` inside your application to script Yeti for your own use.\n\nFor API documentation:\n\n - Run `make html` to build HTML documentation to `./build_docs`.\n - Review code comments inside `lib/yeti.js`, `lib/client.js` and `lib/hub/index.js`.\n\nYeti follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) but is currently at a 0.x.y release. **The public API is not stable.** There will be changes.\n\n### Client-Side Yeti Integration\n\nYeti typically automates test frameworks, but you can integrate any client-side test or performance framework\ninto Yeti. Combined with the Yeti API, you can easily build your own automation tools. YUI uses Yeti in this\nway to automate performance benchmarks.\n\nNormally Yeti will scan pages in order to find test frameworks. When serving a page to Yeti, you can set\n`window.stopYetiScan` to true to signal that your page will explicitly submit results to Yeti.\n\nWhen your framework has results and is ready to move to the next page, you can call `window.sendYetiResults`\nwith an object containing data to report. This data will be passed through verbatim to the Node.js Yeti API\nfor further processing in your tool.\n\n## Caveats\n\n### Platforms\n\nYeti should work on all platforms supported by Node.js.\nIt's tested on Linux and OS X.\n\n### Serving tests\n\nYou must start Yeti's client in the directory you'll be serving tests from. For security reasons, Yeti will reject requests that try to access files outside of the directory you start Yeti in.\n\n## Install latest Yeti snapshot\n\nYou can install the latest development snapshot of Yeti easily:\n\n    npm install -g http://latest.yeti.cx\n\nThis will install Yeti as it exists on the [yui/yeti GitHub repository][github].\nYou can check the stability of the Yeti snapshot by checking [yui/yeti on Travis][travis].\n\n## Develop Yeti\n\nDo you want to add new features or fix bugs in Yeti itself? We made it easy for you to hack on Yeti.\n\n### Experimental: Develop on Windows\n\nAfter running `npm install`, replace the `make` commands below with\n`.\\jake.bat` to use the experimental Jake tasks that are Windows ready.\n\n### Code\n\n#### Install dependencies\n\nClone Yeti.\n\n    git clone https://github.com/yui/yeti.git\n    cd yeti\n\nInstall Yeti's dependencies.\n\n    npm install\n\n#### Run tests & code coverage\n\nYeti's automated tests require PhantomJS.\nYou can [download PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) source or pre-built\nbinaries from their website. Make sure the `phantomjs` binary is installed in your PATH.\n\n    make test\n    make coverage\n\nThe latter command uses [JSCoverage for Node.js][jsc],\nwhich will be built and installed to `./tools/jscoverage`.\n\n#### Linter\n\n    make lint\n\nYou may also run the linter on individual files with `./go lint`:\n\n    ./go lint test/blizzard.js\n\nYeti uses [JSHint][] to analyze code for problems. See `.jshintrc` for options used by Yeti.\n\n#### Profiler\n\nRequires [Google Chrome Canary][canary] and OS X.\n\nProfile the Yeti Hub:\n\n    ./go profile --server\n\nUsing `./go profile` without `--server` to profile the Yeti client\nrequires an interactive terminal, which does not yet work.\n\n### HTML documentation\n\n#### Website\n\nYeti uses [Selleck][] to generate its website. Selleck files are located in `doc/`.\n\n    make html\n\nDocumentation will be built to `build_docs/`.\n\n#### JavaScript API\n\nYeti uses [YUIDocJS][] to generate API documentation from inline JSDoc comment blocks.\n\n    make html-api\n\nDocumentation will be built to `build_docs/api/everything/`.\n\n### Contribute to Yeti\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/yui/yeti/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Bugs & Feedback\n\nOpen a ticket on [YUILibrary.com's Yeti Issue Tracker][issues] to report bugs or feature requests.\n\n## License\n\nYeti is free to use under YUI's BSD license.\nSee the LICENSE file or the [YUI license page](http://yuilibrary.com/license/)\nfor license text and copyright information.\n\n  [Jenkins]: http://jenkins-ci.org/\n  [ee]: https://github.com/davglass/echoecho\n  [ee-usage]: https://github.com/davglass/echoecho#using-in-your-tests\n  [ee-readme]: https://github.com/davglass/echoecho#readme\n  [canary]: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs\n  [github]: https://github.com/yui/yeti\n  [travis]: http://travis-ci.org/yui/yeti\n  [JSHint]: http://jshint.com/\n  [YUIDocJS]: https://github.com/davglass/yuidocjs\n  [Selleck]: http://github.com/rgrove/selleck\n  [jsc]: https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage\n  [localtunnel]: http://localtunnel.com/\n  [node]: http://nodejs.org/\n  [npm]: http://npmjs.org/\n  [issues]: http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yeti/newticket\n  [YUI]: http://yuilibrary.com/\n  [yuitest]: http://yuilibrary.com/yuitest/\n  [QUnit]: http://qunitjs.com/\n  [Mocha]: http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/\n  [Expect.js]: https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js\n  [Jasmine]: http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/\n  [DOH]: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/util/doh.html\n  [doctype]: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype\n  [No-Quirks Mode]: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/dom.html#no-quirks-mode\n  [minimatch]: https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch\n  [Istanbul]: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul\n  [istanbul-report]: https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/tree/master/lib/report\n",
